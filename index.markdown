## Profile

I am dedicated to my continuous personal and professional growth at the intersection of the social sciences and technology, with a primary focus on using education to enrich the humanities. My goal is to leverage technology and innovative methods to reach wider audiences, fostering a deeper understanding of culture and history.

I aim to understand my clients' needs and provide efficient, scalable cybersecurity solutions that safeguard their assets while minimizing downtime and risk.

As I continue my journey to becoming a full-fledged historian, I am passionate about contributing to the field through teaching, community involvement, and research. I seek to engage in social and government projects that promote cultural heritage and regional history, while exploring fresh perspectives and unrecognized subjects in historical research.
