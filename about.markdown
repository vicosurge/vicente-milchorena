My name is Vicente Manuel Mu√±oz Milchorena.

I am a Historian by training, an IT Professional from 15 years of experience,
and an author of several books (none of which have my name, but that is the
trade of a ghost writer).

Here you will find some of the texts that I have written across many years,
all of them are delivered as-is, some have been revised, some are as raw
as they come.

Enjoy.
